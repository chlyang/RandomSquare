 A background pattern generator inspired by James Padolsey's background image. http://james.padolsey.com/

I have no idea if his background image is exclusive to his site, or even created by him. Also, I am sure this is way more verbose and complicated than it has to be. I just wanted to make sure that the larger cells do not overlap or butt up against each other.
